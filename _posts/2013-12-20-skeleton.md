title: Skeleton CSS Boilerplate
---

[Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) version 1.2.

Skeleton is very minimal set of boilerplate CSS.  The project has even gone so far as to remove Javascript and tab features from earlier releases, following their philosophy of not being a UI framework, but just a basic foundation.

The last [Github](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/commits/master) commit was June 20, 2012, so this project may be languishing, or perhaps it meets all the author's desires at the moment.  It does not use LESS, SASS or a similar stylesheet language.  This might be a detriment if a site's CSS becomes complex, or a web application needs to be reskinned.

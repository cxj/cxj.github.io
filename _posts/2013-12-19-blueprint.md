title: Blueprint CSS Framework
---

[Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.org) version 1.0.1.

Right away, the note on Blueprint's homepage that it was last updated May 14, 2011 concerned me.  Two years is an eternity in internet time.  How many major browser versions has Microsoft released in that period of time?  Three, actually:  IE9, IE10 and IE11.

Further investigation shows no [Github](https://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/commits/master) activity since then, either.  None of the bug tickets at [Lighthouse](http://blueprintcss.lighthouseapp.com/projects/15318-blueprint-css/overview) for Blueprint have received a comment by the author since May, 2011 either.  This lack of support and updating is a serious concern, although not necessarily enough to skip looking at this framework completely.  I sent a tweet to [@blueprintcss](https://twitter.com/blueprintcss) and asked what was up with the project.  Hopefully Joshua or someone else involved will reply.

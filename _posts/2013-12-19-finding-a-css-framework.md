title: Finding a CSS Framework
---

I’m a web back-end developer, primarily.  My bread and butter is PHP and C++.  But I also get called on to do front-end web work as well.  I’m comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I want to make my life easier when I do front-end work.  So I’ve been investigating frameworks to help me do that.  The initial list of candidates I want to research and try are: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [Pure](http://purecss.io/), [InK](http://ink.sapo.pt/), [Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.org), [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/), [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com/), [Inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/), [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/), [Workless](http://workless.ikreativ.com/), [320andUp](https://github.com/malarkey/320andup/) and [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/).

I’m sure there’s more!  You can imagine how one’s head starts to spin after just half a dozen.

Because I want to fit my choice into rewriting and refactoring existing web applications which were originally written with in-house custom CSS and JS libraries, a non-“dictatorial” framework would be useful.   That is, a “my way or the highway” design concept (like Ruby on Rails), while good for short-cutting start-up effort for new projects, is not optimal here.

As a couple of my existing web applications have some super-heavy HTML forms (200+ input elements), I think I need to favor lightweight frameworks.

Since my time is in short supply, just like everyone, one that is fairly simple and doesn’t require complicated development infrastructure is attractive.

I also think I want a framework that is semantic, as my design decisions for UI appearance might well need to be changed by someone with a much better eye for design.  Semantic web page mark up also has other benefits.

As I work my way through exmaning each framework, I'll be writing more about my impression of each.
